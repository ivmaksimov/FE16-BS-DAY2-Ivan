          <h1>Game of Thrones (film series)</h1>

          <p>
            Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series
            created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an
            adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by
            George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The
            show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland,
            Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States
            on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes
            broadcast over eight seasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of
            Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs
            throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the
            Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of
            political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim
            the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A
            second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling
            dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and
            reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military
            order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's
            northern border.
          </p>

          <p>
            Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a
            broad, active, and international fan base. Critics have praised the
            series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and
            production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence
            (including sexual violence) has been subject to criticism. The final
            season received significant critical backlash for its reduced length
            and creative decisions, with many considering it a disappointing
            conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most
            by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016,
            2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo
            Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five
            nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series â€“
            Drama. Many critics and publications have named the show as one of
            the best television series of all time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of
            Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the
            fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of
            Essos.[5][6] The series follows several simultaneous plot lines.[7]
            The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing
            claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with
            other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The
            second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne;
            the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as
            the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North

          I'm feeling so heartbroken to see everyone criticising my favourite
          show of all time. And yes of course that's because of the bad making
          of the season finale, I can totally understand that. After all these
          years hardwork, creating and developing each and every character from
          bottom to top, memories, emotions throughout the process all went to
          vain for one bad making. It's so painful to accept it for the audience
          who invested lots of time watching the show from the starting and then
          finishing it like this! It's a long long journey. I don't even
          remember the day I started watching it and since then I waited the
          next year to come for the new season. I can't say anything more. Only
          one last request, could you please delete the whole season 8 and make
          a new version of it? Please?

          It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was
          mesmerizing. It was gripping. It was so shocking that if someone is
          binge watching this show he/she will need a time-off in between to get
          their head around things and accept some messed up, yet mind blowing
          development. But yet, I cant hate it enough after final season. Its
          like you came to know that you were in love with the wrong one all
          along. It was like looking at a completely different person. It was
          like seeing your own dreams and expectations get destroyed. It was not
          a let down, it was a BETRAYAL!

          Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from
          the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard
          nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb
          reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book
          series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of
          Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare
          television show that does its original source material justice and
          treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest,
          most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years.
